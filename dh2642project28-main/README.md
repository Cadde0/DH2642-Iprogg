# dh2642project28
Project group 28, DH2642 course

**Short description of the project**
The project is aiming to show information regarding NHL and its respective teams and players.


**What you have done**
We have implemented all the API calls and structured models to show the data. Furthermore, we have a basic skeleton structure so it's possible to navigate the different pages. 

**What you still plan to do**
* Favorite function (persistance)
* Refactor files and file structures
* Implement CSS
* Continue working on pages and showing more information

**Your project file structure**
The program is structured with the MVP architecture. Every different page has their own presenter view and model (for now, we are planning on refactoring).
